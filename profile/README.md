# Overview

Convened by the [Group on Earth Observations (GEO)](https://earthobservations.org/), the Global Ecosystems Atlas is a cross-sector collaborative initiative to map and monitor the world's ecosystems, providing dynamic visualisations of natural environments.

The Atlas will empower decision-makers with insights for sustainable development and a deeper understanding of Earth's ecological diversity. It will provide everything you need to know about the distribution, change, condition and risks of ecosystems worldwide.

The Atlas combines existing high-quality ecosystem maps with new ecosystem maps developed in-house to fill remaining data gaps. By enabling collaboration across sectors and countries, the Atlas generates knowledge and insights on ecosystems, helps improve and scale existing initiatives, and enhances consistency and coherence in stock-taking, reporting, and decision-making.

# About the Global Ecosystems Atlas GitHub organisation

On these pages you will find the repositories that manage all major units of work to support Atlas production, including: data cataloguing, dataset cross-referencing, map synthesis and app production:

### 1. [Data catalogue](https://github.com/Global-Ecosystems-Atlas/data-catalogue)
This repository contains code and other information used to manage the cataloguing pipeline. In here you'll find lists of all datasets assessed for inclusion in the Atlas, along with detailed information and metadata. 

### 2. [Cross-reference tables](https://github.com/Global-Ecosystems-Atlas/cross-reference-tables)
This repository contains cross-referencing tables which explain how source dataset map classes are assigned to Ecosystem Functional Groups within IUCN's Global Ecosystem Typology.

### 3. [Data processing and synthesis map production](https://github.com/global-ecosystems-atlas/synthesis)
This repository contains code and other information used to process all input data sources and synthesise into the final 119 layers of the Global Ecosystems Atlas.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some commonly asked question and answers about the Atlas:

### Where do Global Ecosystems Atlas datasets come from?

The Global Ecosystems Atlas was created by compiling existing spatial data products developed to represent ecosystems. These maps come from high-quality national, regional, and global repositories. Each dataset has been subjected to a rigorous evaluation process, including validation and harmonization with the IUCN [Global Ecosystem Typology](https://global-ecosystems.org/explore) - an internationally recognized system for classifying ecosystems across terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms.

### What can you do with the Global Ecosystems Atlas?
Lots of things!! The Global Ecosystems Atlas has been designed as a versatile platform for identifying distribution of different ecosystem types, supporting conservation and restoration efforts, informing environmental management decisions, conducting research, and aiding in environmental and corporate reporting. The Atlas does this by bringing together high-quality global, regional and national ecosystem maps into a single, open, online resource. Presenting the extent, structure and function of the world’s ecosystems in unprecedented detail, the Atlas will enable everyone—from governments to individual citizens—to take action to protect nature.

Specific uses of the Atlas include:

#### Tracking progress on the Global Biodiversity Framework
The Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) includes targets to achieve the mission of halting and reversing biodiversity loss. Countries can use the Atlas to access measurements and derive insights that support stock-taking, monitoring and reporting on indicators of progress toward achieving the ecosystem-focused GBF goals and targets.

#### Developing national ecosystem maps where they don’t yet exist
For countries that don’t yet have a national ecosystem classification and map, the Atlas will offer guidelines, resources, examples, map standards to assist countries in developing new maps to use for policy, planning, decision-making and action related to ecosystems and biodiversity.

#### Contributing to Nature-based Solutions
Knowledge about ecosystem distributions will help support a better understanding of nature-based climate solutions and help improve our knowledge of the essential ecosystem services provided by ecosystems around the world.

#### Supporting natural capital accounting
The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is an internationally agreed statistical framework that measures stocks and flows of natural resources, including ecosystems. The Atlas will provide up-to-date data to support generation of SEEA ecosystem accounts.

#### Informing financial disclosures
Under some laws and voluntary frameworks, companies and financial institutions are required to make financial disclosures that describe risks and opportunities related to the climate and nature. The Atlas will offer consistent data to support the effective operation of laws and frameworks.

#### Enhancing financial structuring and risk insurance
An increasing number of countries and communities invest in risk insurance to protect against climate- and nature-related loss and damage. New ecosystems knowledge can lead to new opportunities in financial structuring based on the underlying value of ecosystem services.

# Resources

The Global Ecosystems Atlas has developed a range of resources to support the initiative and to support stakeholders in developing new maps of ecosystems. These include:

#### Data products

- [Global Training and Validation Dataset for Ecosystem Functional Groups](https://geo-global-ecosystems-atlas.projects.earthengine.app/view/trainingdataviewer). An open-access dataset of more than 90,000 human-labelled point data records representing occurrences of 110 Ecosystem Functional Groups. Suitable for training spatial models, evaluating efforts to cross-reference existing map classifications to the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology, or independently validating spatial datasets that were developed to represent ecosystem functional groups. Publication expected in 2026. You can view our labeling progress on our [annotation tracker app](https://geo-global-ecosystems-atlas.projects.earthengine.app/view/trainingdataviewer).
- [Global Ecosystems Atlas Data Catalogue](https://globalecosystemsatlas.org/data/sources-catalogue#tabs). A data catalogue of existing spatial data products that are intended to represent ecosystems ('source datasets'). Searches focus on publicly available data repositories, datasets associated with the scientific literature, and through a program of coordinated outreach to national environment agencies and ecosystem map developers.
- [Global Ecosystems Atlas Synthesis Map](https://globalecosystemsatlas.org/atlas). The Global Ecosystems Atlas synthesis map is a data product designed to support a range of environmental initiatives through the provision of a spatially and thematically consistent geospatial data product that represents the distribution of the world's ecosystems. The data product is a set of 119 Cloud-optimised Geotiffs that include three synthesis, which represent the ecosystem functional group, biomes and realms of the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology, 110 binary layers that represent the 110 individual ecosystem functional groups of the Global Ecosystem Typology, a data mask, and a set of quality assurance data layers that indicate the data provenance, development year and other relevant aspects of data quality.
- [Ecosystem cross-reference tables](https://github.com/Global-Ecosystems-Atlas/cross-reference-tables). These tables cross-reference existing ecosystem maps housed in the Atlas Data Catalogue to the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology. The cross-reference tables are provided in a standard format that complies with the [IUCN cross-referencing guidelines](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2025-026-En.pdf).
